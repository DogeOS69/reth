# Upstream Patch Queue

This branch is based on Reth `eb4c15e5e36d8776d46629beae4c0a69af7ab04f` (`v2.0.0`).

## RocksDB synchronous writes

- **Scope:** `reth-provider` RocksDB write transactions and batches.
- **Source:** exact backport of upstream Reth commit
  `3a136fc8c38221e060cbc31ef5c5fa345cf0e17a` (PR #23603).
- **Purpose:** set `WriteOptions::sync(true)` for transactions, explicit batches, auto-committed
  batches, and final batch commits so a successful commit is durable across a host crash.
- **Compatibility:** this changes write durability only and does not alter the Reth 2 / REVM 36
  dependency family or DogeOS storage encoding.
- **Removal condition:** remove the backport when the selected upstream Reth base contains PR
  #23603 or an equivalent synchronous-write implementation.

## Header transformation hooks

- **Scope:** `reth-network` downloaded-header handling only.
- **Purpose:** provide temporary inbound geth/l2geth-to-Reth historical-header compatibility during
  the controlled pre-Tsuki crossover. Network response heuristics inspect the raw peer response;
  afterward, the asynchronous hook transforms downloaded headers before normal Reth downloader
  validation and persistence.
- **Protocol ownership:** the hook contains no DogeOS or Scroll rules. The configured DogeOS adapter
  owns any required signature restoration and must preserve header count and ordering.
- **Default behavior:** no transform is configured, so downloaded responses follow the upstream
  synchronous delivery path.
- **Serving behavior:** Reth never serves transformed headers; geth nodes must continue syncing
  historical headers from geth peers during the compatibility window.
- **Removal condition:** remove this patch after all nodes have migrated to Reth and the controlled
  compatibility window has ended.

## EIP-3607 empty-code sender validation

- **Scope:** `reth-transaction-pool` sender bytecode validation.
- **Source:** focused backport of upstream Reth commit
  `62808bd060e4c7398e3fb6df93881950b1433b18` (PR #26644).
- **Purpose:** treat `KECCAK_EMPTY` as no deployed code so genesis accounts declared with explicit
  empty code remain valid EIP-3607 senders.
- **Compatibility:** nonempty code remains rejected before Prague; after Prague, only valid EIP-7702
  delegation code remains accepted.
- **Removal condition:** remove the backport when the selected upstream Reth base contains PR
  #26644 or equivalent EIP-3607 empty-code handling.

## Trusted peer revocation

- **Scope:** `reth-network` trusted peer set and trusted peer resolver.
- **Source:** exact backport of upstream Reth commit
  `b05e68db85fb29c4eaa707728171acb0fd0cd23d` (PR #24406), and a focused backport of upstream Reth
  commit `f9858796a53be55d5861b13e0eb6b22d8af85f9e` (PR #27948).
- **Purpose:** removing a trusted peer always drops its id from the trusted set and the resolver,
  even when the peer has no record or a non-trusted record, so a revoked peer no longer passes the
  `--trusted-only` admission check.
- **Compatibility:** the function body matches upstream. The upstream test's admin ban assertions
  are omitted because this branch does not carry PR #25140 (`admin` ban and unban methods).
- **Removal condition:** remove the backport when the selected upstream Reth base contains PRs
  #24406 and #27948.
